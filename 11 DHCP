Take 2 Pc 1 Server And 1 Switch
Click on the Server → go to the Desktop tab → click IP Configuration.
Give the server a static IP address (so it won’t change).
IP Address: 192.168.1.1

Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1
Turn on the dhcp service on server by going to the services tab in server

Click on PC0 → go to Desktop tab → click IP Configuration.
Select DHCP instead of Static.
Wait a few seconds — you’ll see the IP auto-assigned:

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
Default Gateway: 192.168.1.1
DNS: 8.8.8.8
Do the same for PC1 and PC2 — they will get the next IPs:
PC1 → 192.168.1.11
PC2 → 192.168.1.12

Open Command Prompt on any PC (Desktop → Command Prompt).
Type:
ipconfig
→ You should see the IP address given by the DHCP server.
Type:
ping 192.168.1.1
→ You should get a reply, meaning the PC can reach the DHCP Server.
